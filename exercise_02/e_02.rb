# Daffy Duckify a users string replacing each 's' with 'th'.

# Ask user to `Enter any string` and store it into a variable.

# Convert response into lowercase.

#Use include? method to see if the response contains letter 's'.

# If the string contains  letter 's' substitute it with 'th' using `gsub!`  method else print `Nothing to replace`.
